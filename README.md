# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

In this project we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

## Technologies

This project was built using React.jsx and Vite. It's been hosted on Github Pages. Information is complied using a variety of filter and map methods on the arrays of data collected from the API and rendered onto the page according to the data recieved.
